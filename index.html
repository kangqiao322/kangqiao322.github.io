        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Kang Qiao, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computing (Honours) in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I am passionate about software development, with a strong interest in contributing to impactful projects that benefit both the university community and the larger tech ecosystem. My experience in building scalable, real-world applications and my enthusiasm for learning make me a strong candidate for the Orbital Skylab Developer position.
        </p>
        <h2>My Journey and Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Over the past few years, I have honed my skills through internships, academic projects, and independent learning. As an intern at GovTech Singapore, I contributed to a citizen-centric application that streamlined government services, focusing on improving performance and user experience. During my internships at Connect2Me Pte Ltd and GovTech, I worked on Frontend ecosystems using React, Typescript, Express and Nodejs along with backend APIs and data pipelines, which deepened my understanding of scalable architecture. Additionally, my participation in the NUS Orbital Programme 2022 allowed me to develop a mobile game application, earning me valuable insights into teamwork and agile methodologies.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Skylab Developer?</h2>
        <p>
            The Orbital Skylab Developer role aligns perfectly with my aspirations to contribute to the NUS community through technology. Skylab's mission of supporting Orbital projects resonates with my desire to mentor and empower others in their learning journeys. I want to help create tools that enhance the Orbital Programme, making it even more accessible and rewarding for future cohorts.
        </p>
        <h2>My Commitment</h2>
        <p>
            As a Skylab Developer, I will bring my technical expertise, collaborative spirit, and passion for innovation to the team. I thrive in dynamic environments and am committed to delivering high-quality solutions. With my experience and drive, I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to Skylab's goals while growing as a developer and mentor.
        </p>
